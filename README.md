## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I learned a bit more about the grid system and how to use the size of the columns to avoid media queries.

I was stuck on the background color of the button on the hover state. I first fiddled with opacity, but that would still require a separate section of css for each card. I discovered the inherit property. A simple property, but one I have never used or really thought about. New little gem for my toolbox.
